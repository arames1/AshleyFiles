                    <p>As human beings we all create a carbon footprint based upon the activities that we are involved in, which contribute carbon dioxide to the environment and have an impact on the earth.  Just as our actions have an impact on the earth in terms of our carbon footprint, so too do our activities have an impact upon those people that we come into contact with.  We all get a chance to shape our legacy, and there are certain steps that we can take to make sure that ours is a positive one.
